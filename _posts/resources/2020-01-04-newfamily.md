As the sliver of sky started to grow horizontally, it expanded to the horizon on the east side. Within a minute, the clouds start to turn pink, catching a sun form a place yet I can not see. In a moment later, a tiny dot of light burst out of the roof of the building distance away quietly. It grows and grows as I on the earth turn towards it. What a moment that visualize the speed of turn of the earth and allows me to feel the time passing, seconds to years.
