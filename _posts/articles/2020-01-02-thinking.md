Seeing a sunrise has been my family tradition since I was growing up. My family would go climb Mutsugatake mountain bringing some tea. I remember arriving on the top of the mountain when the sky is getting yellow, there were so many people already waiting for the moment chatting eating drinking tea. What a strange creature we are who go though a trouble to gather on top of the mountain to see a sun rises just like it does every day. But this makes our lives special and make us realize that this beautiful encounter is worth seeking out for. The moments that reorient our prospective and revitalize beauty and ephemeral quality of our experiences.
